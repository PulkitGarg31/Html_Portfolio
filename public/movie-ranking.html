<p>Movie is Decent but exciting as I was a kid when I watched this in the theatre</p>
<h3>Jurrasic World</h3>
<p>Movie was amazing as seeing dinosours infront of you is always fun</p>
<h3>Dunki</h3>
<p>Movie was emotional sensative movie great in the departments of acting and dialouge 
but lacks somewhere in background music and the cg and vfx </p>
